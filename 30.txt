# IPv6 basics

Addresses are 128 bits
Commonly represented as hexadecimal:
* each digit is a "nibble" (a half byte -- bad pun warning)
* each group of four nibbles ("quibble") separated by colons
* leading zeroes of quibbles are removed
* groups of zero quibbles are replaced with :: (but only once)

2620:00fc:c000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0042
                     = 2620:fc:c000::42
