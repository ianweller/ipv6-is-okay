# IPv6 basics

CIDR is /the/ routing language for IPv6

2600::/29 -- 29 fixed bits, 99 remain
2^(128-29) = 2^99 = 6.338 e29 addresses

Stateless autoconfig (we'll get into that) requires a /64 subnet,
so networks are most commonly a /64 (as recommended by RFC)

ARIN (American Registry for Internet Numbers) will generally allocate a /48 for each "site"
(but they're happy to hand out more)
There are 17 592 186 044 416 globally-routable /48s (for now)

Regional registries are still handing out blocks from /12s delegated in 2006

You can get a /60 from Comcast et al (with DHCPv6 prefix delegation)
