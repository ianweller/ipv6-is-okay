# Combating IPv4 exhaustion

Network address translation (NAT)
RFC1918 private address spaces

Internet-connected computers don't need publicly routable addresses

10.0.0.0/8     -- 16 777 216 addresses (class A)
172.16.0.0/12  --  1 048 576 addresses
192.168.0.0/16 --     65 536 addresses (class B)

(Clearly no company would ever need more than a /8 of addresses!)
