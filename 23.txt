# Combating IPv4 exhaustion

TLS Server Name Indication extension
Client includes hostname in TLS handshake

Prior to this, each SSL/TLS server needed its own public IP address:
* certificates generally only support one domain
* no way for server to pick which certificate to choose
* sadness and general distraught

(This is why load balancers with dedicated IPs cost a lot of money!)

Almost(!) all commonly-used TLS servers/clients now support SNI
