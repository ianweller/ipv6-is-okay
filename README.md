# "IPv6 is okay"

On Tuesday, I read an email suggesting that I introduce the subject of IPv6 to my team (we make Amazon Linux and recently worked to add IPv6-in-VPC support).

On Thursday, I gave the presentation in a very opinionated manner. These are the slides I used to guide myself.

My experience comes from a few years of operating IPv6 on a home network, operating AS64241 (Wobscale) for nearly a year, and being our team's point of contact to the rest of AWS for IPv6 on Linux distros on EC2.

I presented the slides by running `vim *.txt`. My terminal was 23 lines tall at the time (vim showed 21 lines because my statusline is always present). And yes, I realize that these are Markdown files with a .txt extension -- I used single line breaks as paragraph breaks often for the sake of space, and didn't want GitHub to render them wrong.

Feel free to open an issue if you would like me to elaborate on anything.
