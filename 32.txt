# IPv6 basics

Global scope (generally) addresses start with '2' (2000::/4)
Link local addresses are in fe80::/64
Local multicast addresses are in ff02::/12

DNS A records: IPv4 addresses
DNS AAAA records: IPv6 addresses
(because IPv6 is four times as many bits...)

There is /no/ network address translation, by design (this has made a lot of people angry)

The first and last address of a network are still usable
