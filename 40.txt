# Stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)

SLAAC is merely the existence of a prefix in a Router Advertisement;
the client picks an address, does duplicate address detection, and goes

SLAAC just fills in an EUI-64 in the last 64 bits of a /64 prefix

Windows generates a random DUID, which becomes an EUI-64 (somehow)
Linux converts the 48-bit MAC address (actually an EUI-48) into EUI-64:

```
00:53:53   :   c0:ff:ee    |  Standard MAC address
00:53:53:ff:fe:c0:ff:ee    |  Insert ff:fe in the middle
02:53:53:ff:fe:c0:ff:ee    |  Flip the seventh bit
fe80::0253:53ff:fec0:ffee  |  In link local address form
```

Some people don't like their MAC address being their public IP address
